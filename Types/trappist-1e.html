                <h2>About Trappist-1e</h2>
                <p>
                    TRAPPIST-1e is one of seven Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting the ultra-cool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, located about 40 light-years from Earth in the Aquarius constellation. It is one of the most promising candidates for studying habitability outside our solar system, as it lies within the star's habitable zone, where liquid water could potentially exist. TRAPPIST-1e has a rocky composition, a size and mass similar to Earth, and receives about the same amount of radiation from its star as Earth does from the Sun. However, its atmosphere and conditions remain under study to determine whether it could support life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Discovered in 2017, TRAPPIST-1e is one of the seven Earth-sized planets orbiting the TRAPPIST-1 star, located approximately 40 light-years away from Earth. With a mass and size similar to Earth's, TRAPPIST-1e is located within its star's habitable zone, where conditions might allow for liquid water to exist on its surface. This makes it a prime candidate for studying potential habitability. Although its atmosphere and surface conditions are still being researched, scientists are intrigued by its potential to support life due to its favorable position and Earth-like characteristics.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mass:</strong> Approximately 0.91 times that of Earth</li>
                    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Similar to Earth</li>
                    <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> 6.1 Earth days</li>
                    <li><strong>Distance from Star:</strong> About 0.029 AU (astronomical units)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conditions on Trappist-1e</h3>
                <p>
                    TRAPPIST-1e orbits within the habitable zone of its ultra-cool dwarf star, where conditions may allow liquid water to exist on the surface. The planet's density suggests a rocky composition, and its moderate radiation levels make it a candidate for potential habitability. However, further study is needed to confirm the presence of an atmosphere and surface conditions.
                </p>
                <h3>Potential for Life</h3>
                <p><strong>Habitability:</strong> TRAPPIST-1e is a promising candidate for hosting life due to its location in the habitable zone, its Earth-like size, and mass.</p>
                <p><strong>Radiation:</strong> The low-energy emissions of the TRAPPIST-1 star, along with fewer stellar flares compared to more active stars, offer a less hostile environment for potential habitability. However, the planet's atmospheric composition and protection from stellar radiation remain under investigation.</p>

                <h3>Exploration and Future Research</h3>
                <p><strong>Scientific Interest:</strong> TRAPPIST-1e has attracted significant attention as a key target for studying exoplanet habitability and comparative planetology.</p>
                <p><strong>Telescopic Observations:</strong>  Future missions, such as those involving the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), aim to study TRAPPIST-1e's atmosphere and detect potential biosignatures, offering insights into its habitability.
